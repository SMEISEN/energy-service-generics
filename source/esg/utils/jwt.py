class AccessTokenChecker:
    """
    A tool that can be used to verify access tokens in JWT format.

    This class is intended to operate with JWT based access tokens as they
    are issued by IDPs implementing OpenID Connect. It is in particular
    implemented to operate on JWTs issued by Keycloak. Other IDPs may work
    too or not at all.

    Beyond the usually checking of JWT attributes this class furthermore
    allows to verify if certain `roles` have been assigned to the user.
    This role checking enables fine grained authorization like e.g.
    dedicated permissions for each endpoint of an API.

            Definition where the roles should be found in the JWT.
